        <h2>Life should have more Mountains and less stress.</h2>
        <p id="author"><i>Shriya Shrestha</i></p>
        <p>The mountains stand tall, their snow-capped peaks piercing the clear blue sky, casting long shadows over the valleys below. Majestic and serene, they command the landscape with their sheer size and beauty. The crisp, cool air carries the scent of pine from the dense forests that blanket the lower slopes, where rivers cut through the land like silver threads. Sunlight dances on the surface of a crystal-clear lake, reflecting the grandeur of the mountains, while birds soar effortlessly above. In this peaceful solitude, the mountains exude a timeless presence, offering a sense of calm and wonder to all who venture near.</p>

        <p>Amid the towering mountains, a deep sense of tranquility prevails. The jagged ridges, carved by centuries of wind and weather, rise like ancient sentinels guarding the horizon. As clouds drift lazily around the peaks, their shadows create shifting patterns across the landscape, adding a mystical quality to the scene. Below, the alpine meadows are dotted with wildflowers, their vibrant colors contrasting against the rugged terrain. A cool breeze whispers through the trees, carrying the distant sound of cascading waterfalls. In this untouched wilderness, time seems to slow, and the mountains offer a quiet refuge from the world below.</p>
